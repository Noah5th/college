 <h1>Police Officer</h1>
 <center><p>I want to be a police officer after I get out of college. My dad is a police officer and I have always wanted to be one. I am not a huge fan of school either, and being a police officer only requires two years of college. Police officers can also help with car accidents and other things. I think helping people as a police officer would be a good idea for me. I don't know what I want to do, so I decided on being a police officer. Becoming a police officer would be easier than pursuing somehting that I never thought about doing before.</p></center>

<h3>Police officers in training</h3>
<center><p>Being a police officer takes some special training that you have to take classes for. You will have to take tests at the shooting range and also learn how to drive the police car. Shooting at the range will test eye sight, accuracy, and ability to handle the weapon whem shotting at a target. There are also written tests that you will have to take. Studying doesn't end once you get out of school, there is always more to come. After working for so long you can test out of being a sergeant. A sergent is a promotion up from a officer, after working for so many years you can test to be one.</p></center>

<center><p>Police officers have to do many jobs such as taking reports on crashes, murders, and even more. They have a homicide unit which is disbatched when their is a homicide. They have to look at the evidence at the scene of the crim, find suspects and try to fiding out who did the crime. When ever you see a car crash, you will always see police officers on the scene of the crash. They have to figure out what happended,take a report, and also write tickets depending on whose fault it was.The average salary for a police officer is around 60k.
